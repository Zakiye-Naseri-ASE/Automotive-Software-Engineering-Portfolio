# Automotive-Software-Engineering-Portfolio
This repository contains my practical work for the "Embedded Programming" and "Automotive Software Engineering" course (Summer Semester 2025). The projects progress from low-level register manipulation on an SPC56EL60 microcontroller to high-level AUTOSAR application design and integration testing.
